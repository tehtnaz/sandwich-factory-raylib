# sandwich-factory-raylib
A remake of my first game with unity, on raylib, making it also my first game made with raylib.

Features:
  * Lever-controlled doors
  * Crates with custom physics
    * Can be grabed
  * Camera following (not seen in game)
  * You choose your own FPS and resolution
    * Any selected FPS above 30 is 100% functional (ie. if you have a high refresh rate monitor, you can choose a higher FPS)
    * Recommended Resolution >= 540p
    * _Only supported aspect ratio is 16:9!!_

New to Beta 2:
  * It is now possible to load custom files
    * Ladders are supported in the files but will not be rendered in the game.
  * I don't plan on making a documentation yet so please refer to the dataHandling.h file where I kept my info

Future Features (not yet ported to raylib version):
  * Ladders
  * Portals
  * Crates can interact among themselves
